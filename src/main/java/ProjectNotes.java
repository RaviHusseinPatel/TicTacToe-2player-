Were gonna have 1 player, a 2nd player, a board, and x and o symbols

GAME CLASS AND GAMESATUS ENUM:
After making our player and game class, we can create a game enum. Why? To note the status of the game in question.
NOTE: we must add this enum as a property in our game class
We had many issues deciding how to make our board, we tried many options and decided on a 2D array, as seen as the last proeprty in the game class
